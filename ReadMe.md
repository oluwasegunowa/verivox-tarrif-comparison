# Verivox task
Tarrif Comparison


.NET Core 5.0

Task description
-----------------------------------------------

Find below desgin pattern, frameworks and tools used in executing the task given;
 
1. Domain Driven Design & Repository Pattern
2. Documentation - Swagger
3. Logging - Serilog
4. Database -  Postgress
5. Unit Testing - xUnit, Moq
6. Global exception handling


Layers
---------------------------------------------
For the task, I tried to Keep It Simple by using folders to separate the layers.
1. Presentation -> Controllers, Views (but none for this project)
2. Application -> Business Use cases
3. Domain -> Global Error Handling, Extensions, Entities etx
4. Infrastructure -> Connection to database, third party integrations (none in this case)


Assumptions based on project understanding
-------------------------------------------
1. Supplied Consumption must be greater than 0 (Exception is thrown if not)
2. More products can be created in future
To do that, implement ITarrifModel, provide the name and calculation for the new tarrif model. The follwing are the default Model

- BasicConsumptionTarrif
- PackagedConsumptionTarrif

3. The product is to return Annual cost and tarrif name ( I will suggest, the consumption is also returned)




Setup: Check the following to setup the project
--------------------------------------
1. Provide valid postgress database connection string and run the appliaction for the database to be automatically created.

Host={Server_Here};user id={Database_User};password={Database_Password};database={Database_Name};Port=5432


Provide a valid database connection string, when you run the application
the database is created automatically.
